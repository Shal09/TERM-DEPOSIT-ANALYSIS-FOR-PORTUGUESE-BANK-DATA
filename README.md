Aim of the Project![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d50b8c9-e7e7-4919-a4a0-04c94b5ce37d)

I want to create a system that helps to decide which customers to target in  marketing campaigns for term deposits. This system will predict if a customer is likely to say "yes" or "no" to a term deposit offer.

Calculate the Expected Value Framework which is the based on the Machine Learning Prediction and taking managerial decisions.

Clustering is explored to find customers who should be targeted for successful conversion.

The model successfully predicts the Term Deposit
Predicting whether a customer will opt for a term deposit subscription can be very useful for various purposes like targeted marketing, resource allocation, and improving customer satisfaction
Time and resources can be used more efficiently by adopting this model
